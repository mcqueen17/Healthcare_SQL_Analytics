# Patient Readmissions Analysis
## Executive Summary:

This project investigates why patients return to the hospital within 30 days of discharge and which factors signal higher risk. Using real-world health encounter patterns, the analysis examines clinical, demographic, and utilization variables to highlight opportunities for prevention and improved care planning.
The project includes:

1. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of patient-level trends

2. Feature engineering for clinical risk indicators

3. Statistical summaries and visualizations of readmission drivers

4. Readmission rate calculations at the hospital, unit, and diagnosis level

5. Predictive insights identifying high-risk cohorts

6. Actionable recommendations based on data patterns

This project demonstrates real-world healthcare analytic skills, including data cleaning, transformation, risk segmentation, and outcome evaluation.

### Business Problem: 

Unplanned readmissions are costly, preventable events that signal gaps in care coordination and follow-up. Limited data-driven insight into which patients are at highest risk restricts proactive intervention. This project analyzes encounter data to identify key drivers of readmissions and support strategies that reduce return visits, lower costs, and improve patient outcomes.
