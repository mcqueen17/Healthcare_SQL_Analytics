# Patient Readmissions Analysis
This project investigates why patients return to the hospital within 30 days of discharge and which factors signal higher risk. Using real-world health encounter patterns, the analysis examines clinical, demographic, and utilization variables to highlight opportunities for prevention and improved care planning.
The project includes:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of patient-level trends

Feature engineering for clinical risk indicators

Statistical summaries and visualizations of readmission drivers

Readmission rate calculations at the hospital, unit, and diagnosis level

Predictive insights identifying high-risk cohorts

Actionable recommendations based on data patterns

This project demonstrates real-world healthcare analytic skills, including data cleaning, transformation, risk segmentation, and outcome evaluation.
