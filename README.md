# Healthcare SQL Analytics

This repository contains SQL-based healthcare analytics case studies focused on utilization, readmissions, length of stay, and payer mix. The queries are designed to mirror real-world healthcare quality and utilization reporting used by hospitals and managed care organizations.

## Project Focus
- Hospital utilization and discharge trends
- 7-day and 30-day readmission analysis
- Length of stay (LOS) metrics
- Payer mix and utilization patterns
- Identification of high-utilizer patients

## Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced SQL querying (T-SQL style)
- Healthcare quality metric logic (CMS-aligned)
- Conditional aggregation and date-based analysis
- Readmission and utilization rate calculations
- Translating raw data into actionable insights

## Repository Structure

## Example Business Questions Answered
- What percentage of discharges result in a 30-day readmission?
- Which primary medical conditions have the highest readmission rates?
- How does length of stay vary by condition and payer?
- Which patients account for repeated utilization?
- How does utilization differ across payer types?

## Notes
These queries are written using synthetic healthcare datasets for demonstration purposes and reflect patterns commonly analyzed in healthcare analytics and quality improvement teams.
